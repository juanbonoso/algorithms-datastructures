//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
Breath First Search
//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 
BFS (DFS WILL TAKE LONG TIME)
//If the tree is very wide:
DFS (BFS WILL TOO MUCH MEMORY, WILL TRACK NODES ON ALL THE SAME LEVEL)
//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
Depth First Search (WILL BE QUICKER THAN BFS)
//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
Depth First Search  (THE REASON FOR DFS TO EXIST)
//Finding the shortest path:
Breath First Search (BFS)
